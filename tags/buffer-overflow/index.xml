      <description>I remember my college days, the good old days. The time we spend with friends. The most troublesome part of it was the exam. when I try to remember the answer to a question all I can remember was English songs. I never questioned that behavior, maybe because I love songs or maybe even if I try I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to find an answer. Now when I recall those moments I can tell you one thing for sure, my brain cells holding question answers were overwritten by song lyrics.</description>

      <description>We now know the basics but that&amp;rsquo;s not enough we&amp;rsquo;ve to dig a little deeper. Data is being pushed and popped out of the stack as a program executes. But have you ever wondered how the system keeps track of this execution? That&amp;rsquo;s when registers come into play. Registers are small memory units in the CPU capable of holding a small amount of data (memory addresses). As a program execute these registers instruct the system what to execute next and where to return after a function terminates.</description>

      <description>Buckle up, things are about to get serious now. Consider this as a real-world CTF where the machine is intentionally made vulnerable. Similarly, we will make a vulnerable C program and compile it by disabling all stack protection mechanisms. The compiler and OS will protect the system from such attacks by enabling protection mechanisms such as ASLR&amp;amp;NXÂ .
 ASLRrandomizes the location where system executables are loaded into memory. Making it difficult to guess memory address.</description>
