      <description>We all love playing Hide &amp;amp; Seek. A game we enjoyed playing in our childhood. The rules were so simple, one person would close their eyes and start counting (often counted as 50) while other players would hide. The seeker then opens his eyes and tries to find the hiders; the first to be found will become the next seeker, and the last is the winner of the round. There are different versions of the game in different regions but weâ€™ll focus on this.</description>
